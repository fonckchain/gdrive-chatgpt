# ChatGPT + Google Drive App with LangChain and Python

This project demonstrates how to build a Python app powered by GPT and Google Drive. This combination is made possible by LangChain's Google Drive document loader and serves as a foundation for an infinite number of great apps.

## Why LangChain?

LangChain is a framework for building complex LLM powered apps. It provides functionalities like:

- Importing and transforming data so that it's usable with ChatGPT.
- Allowing your LLM powered app to interact with the outside world.
- Making it easy to swap out your current LLM for a new one without rewriting a lot of code.
- Providing retries with exponential backoffs for free.
